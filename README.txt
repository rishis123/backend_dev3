This is my work in Cornell's Backend Development class week 3 -- work with relational databases (foreign keys to link SQL tables) and building my experience with CRUD API calls. My postman tests are also attached -- I find them very helpful for debugging edge cases that are difficult to do so through simply the local host url.
